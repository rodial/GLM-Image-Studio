A fully containerized, optimized Web UI to run the **GLM-Image** model (16B parameters) on **AMD GPUs** using ROCm. 
Specifically tested and optimized for the **Radeon Strix Halo gfx1151**.

## ✨ Features

- **AMD ROCm Support:** Built on `rocm/pytorch` with critical fixes for BFloat16 and Apex conflicts.
- ~~Hybrid Memory Management:** Custom sequential offloading pipeline enabling the massive 16B model to run on 24GB VRAM without OOM crashes~~ Full load to VRAM, need 39+GB.
- **Robust Web UI (Gradio):**
  - **Text-to-Image & Image-to-Image:** Seamless mode switching.
  - **Reactive Controls:** Sliders automatically adjust to maintain aspect ratios.
  - **Safety First:** Stop Generation and Emergency Exit buttons included.
  - **Clean Interface:** redundant progress bars hidden for a cleaner look.
- **Queue System:** Prevents race conditions and state corruption during multiple requests.
- **One-Click Run:** `run_glm.sh` handles Docker mounting, permissions, and GPU access.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- **OS:** Linux (Arch/Manjaro recommended).
- **GPU:** AMD Radeon GPU (RDNA3.5 / gfx1151) with ROCm drivers.
- **Software:** Docker installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
- **RAM:** At least 32GB System RAM recommended for model offloading.
